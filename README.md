## Project 1- Sarcasm Detector
Sarcasm has been part of our language for many years. It means being the opposite of what you mean, usually with a distinct tone of voice in a fun way. If you think that anyone can understand sarcasm, then you are wrong, because understanding sarcasm depends on your language skills and your knowledge of other peopleâ€™s minds. But what about a computer? Is it possible to train a machine learning model that can detect whether a sentence is sarcastic or not? Yes, it is! So if you want to learn how to detect sarcasm with machine learning, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through the task of Sarcasm Detection with Machine Learning using Python.
